# PietPlus
A JavaScript-based IDE and Interpreter (to come).

Piet is an esoteric programming language, which is based on the geometric artist Piet Mondriaan. The language specifies actions based on the transitions of colors. For a detailed explanation, please visit [the official website](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html)

## WORK-IN-PROGRESS

- Compiler??
- Shortcuts (Ex: 'x' for 'push')
- Color filter (only allow typical 20 Piet colors)
- Grid Scaling instead of Scrolling

_Note: This is my first ever legitimate attempt at developing in JavaScript. Some code has been taken from other sources, especially in the beginning stages of development. I will attribute each source I have used below._
