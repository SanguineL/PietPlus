# PietPlus
A JavaScript-based IDE and Interpreter for Piet.

Piet is an esoteric programming language, which is based on the geometric artist Piet Mondriaan. The language specifies actions based on the transitions of colors. For a detailed explanation, please visit [the official website](https://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/piet.html)

## WORK-IN-PROGRESS
- Step Debugging
- Different Codel Sizes
- Shortcuts
- Color Filter
- Grid Scaling

## Features
- IDE
- Interpreter
- Real-time runtime display (active codels, current stack, CC, DP)
- Self-Correcting Color List
- Block Size Display
- Fill Option
- Import from Image
- Export to Image

## Future Additions
- Step Debugging
- Different Codel Sizes
- Improved Layout
- Compiler??
- Shortcuts (Ex: 'x' for 'push')
- Color filter (only allow typical 20 Piet colors)
- Grid Scaling instead of Scrolling

_Note: This is my first ever legitimate attempt at developing in JavaScript. Some code has been taken from other sources, especially in the beginning stages of development. I will attribute each source I have used below._

_Second Note: According to my tests, the Interpreter is correct in its traversal and behavior. If it is not, please let me know._

_Third Note: Would not recommend having a grid much larger than 50x50._
